// 1. 
// Define a random number, use math.floor so that it will not be a decimal. 
// Then, using .querySelector, makes variables for guesses, the last guess, if the guess is
// too low or too high, a place to submit your guess, and a guess field.
let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100 ) + 1;
const guesses = document.querySelector('.guesses');

// 2.
// let guessCount = 1, and let resetButton (we will come back to these)
let guessCount = 1;
let resetButton;

// 3. 
function checkGuess() {
// declare a variable called userGuess and sets its value to the current value entered inside the text field.  We also run this value through the built-in Number() method just to make sure the value is definitely a number.
let userGuess = Number(guessField.value);

// test if guessCount === 1. If it is, make the guesses paragraph's text 
// content equal to "Previous guesses: ". If not, don't.
if (guessCount === 1) {
guesses.textContent = 'Previous guesses: ';
}

// appends the current userGuess value onto the end of the guesses paragraph, plus a blank 
// space so there will be a space between each guess shown.
guesses.textContent += userGuess + ' ';

// The first if(){ } checks whether the user's guess is equal to the randomNumber set at the top of our JavaScript. If it is, the player has guessed correctly and the game is won, so we show the player a congratulations message with a nice green color, clear the contents of the Low/High guess information box, and run a function called setGameOver(), which we'll discuss later.
if (userGuess === randomNumber) {
lastResult.textContent = 'Congratulations! You got it right!';
lastResult.style.backgroundColor = 'green';

}
// Now we've chained another test onto the end of the last one using an else if(){ } structure. This one checks whether this turn is the user's last turn. If it is, the program does the same thing as in the previous block, except with a game over message instead of a congratulations message.
else if (guessCount === 5) {
lastResult.textContent = '!!!GAME OVER!!!';
setGameOver();
} 

// The final block chained onto the end of this code (the else { }) contains code that is only run if neither of the other two tests returns true (i.e. the player didn't guess right, but they have more guesses left). In this case we tell them they are wrong, then we perform another conditional test to check whether the guess was higher or lower than the answer, displaying a further message as appropriate to tell them higher or lower.

// The last three lines in the function (lines 26–28 above) get us ready for the next guess to be submitted. We add 1 to the guessCount variable so the player uses up their turn (++is an incrementation operation — increment by 1), and empty the value out of the form text field and focus it again, ready for the next guess to be entered.

// At this point we have a nicely implemented checkGuess() function, but it won't do anything because we haven't called it yet. Ideally we want to call it when the "Submit guess" button is pressed, and to do this we need to use an event. Events are things that happen in the browser — a button being clicked, a page loading, a video playing, etc. — in response to which we can run blocks of code. 
// Here we are adding an event listener to the guessSubmit button. This is a method that takes two input values (called arguments) — the type of event we are listening out for (in this case click) as a string, and the code we want to run when the event occurs (in this case the checkGuess() function). Note that we don't need to specify the parentheses when writing it inside addEventListener()).
guessSubmit.addEventListener('click', checkGuess);


function setGameOver() {
// The first two lines disable the form text input and button by setting their disabled properties to true. This is necessary, because if we didn't, the user could submit more guesses after the game is over, which would mess things up.
guessField.disabled = true;
guessSubmit.disabled = true;

// The next three lines generate a new <button> element, set its text label to "Start new game", and add it to the bottom of our existing HTML.
resetButton = document.createElement('button');

document.body.appendChild(resetButton);

// The final line sets an event listener on our new button so that when it is clicked, a function called resetGame() is run.
resetButton.addEventListener('click', resetGame);

// Define function resetGame()
function resetGame() {
// guessCount goes back to 1
guessCount = 1;

// empties all of the text out of the info paragraphs
  const resetParas = document.querySelectorAll('.resultParas p');
for (let i = 0 ; i < resetParas.length ; i++) {
resetParas[i].textContent = '';
}

// removes the reset button
  resetButton.parentNode.removeChild(resetButton);

// Enables the form elements, and empties and focuses the text field, ready for a new guess to be entered
guessField.disabled = false;
guessSubmit.disabled = false;
guessField.value = '';
guessField.focus();

// Removes the background color from the lastResult paragraph
  lastResult.style.backgroundColor = 'white';

// Generates a new random number so that you are not just guessing the same number again
